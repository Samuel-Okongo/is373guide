# Student Guide to Software Development

### Welcome to Software Development!

This site serves as a comprehensive guide to key topics in modern software development, including Containerization, Virtualization, Docker, and Kubernetes. We'll explore how each of these technologies functions and how they play a critical role in the software development process. Whether you're new to development or looking to expand your skills, this guide will serve as a helpful source of information.


## Introduction to Containers

Containerization packages applications along with their dependencies into isolated environments called containers. This ensures consistency across different computing environments. Containers make software portable, reliable, and easier to manage. Think of it like packing everything you need for a picnic into one basket so nothing is forgotten when you move locations. 



Containerization, using tools like **Docker** and **Kubernetes**, simplifies the development and deployment of applications. It ensures portability, scalability, and consistency, making it a must-know technology for modern software development.
